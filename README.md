# üõçÔ∏è Blinkit Sales and Inventory Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

This project features an interactive Blinkit Sales and Inventory Analysis Dashboard developed using Microsoft Power BI. The dashboard is designed to provide quick, insightful, and comprehensive analysis of the popular "India's Last Minute App" retail performance. By focusing on key metrics related to sales, item performance, and outlet characteristics, this tool empowers operations teams and business leaders to optimize inventory, manage product mix, and enhance overall outlet profitability.

# Project Objectives
The primary objectives for developing this Blinkit Sales and Inventory Analysis Dashboard were:

Analyze Sales Drivers: Deeply investigate the relationship between sales performance and key categorical variables, specifically Fat Content (Low Fat vs. Regular) and Item Type, to guide product stocking and promotion decisions.

Evaluate Outlet Performance: Compare the sales, item volume, and average sales across various Outlet Locations, Outlet Sizes (Medium, Small, High), and Outlet Types (Supermarket Type 1, Grocery Store, etc.) to identify top-performers and underperformers.

Monitor Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Track high-level metrics such as Total Sales, No. of Items sold, Average Sales, and the Average Rating to provide an immediate snapshot of business health.

Visualize Sales Distribution: Clearly visualize the breakdown of total sales by critical dimensions like Fat Content and Outlet Size using pie/donut charts for intuitive understanding of revenue contribution.

Historical Trend Analysis: Provide a historical context by visualizing the growth or establishment trend of outlets over time, such as the Outlet Establishment chart shown.
Key Features & Insights Derived
The dashboard is built around interactivity and visual clarity, incorporating the following key features:

Filter Panel: A prominent Filter Panel on the left allows dynamic slicing of all visuals based on Outlet Location, Outlet Size, and Item Type, providing granular analysis capabilities.

Core KPIs: Clearly displayed KPI cards summarizing the total performance: Total Sales (\$1.20M), Average Sales (\$141), **No. of Items (\text{8523}) **, and Average Rating (\text{3.9}).

Item Type Contribution: A bar chart showing the sales contribution by Item Type, where Fruits and Vegetables (\$0.18M) and Snack Foods (\$0.16M) are identified as the leading revenue generators.

Outlet and Fat Content Breakdown: Donut charts vividly illustrate the distribution:

Outlet Size: Shows sales are dominated by the Medium outlet size (\$507.90\text{K}, 42.27\%) compared to others.

Fat Content: Allows comparison of sales between Low Fat and Regular products.
 
  Outlet Type Performance Table: A detailed table comparing sales and item volume across different Outlet Types, clearly showing Supermarket Type 1 as the highest contributor to both total sales and item volume.
